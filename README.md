# Introduction

I am curious about Data Analyst and start to dig more information on the internet then find Luke Barousse YouTube channel and started to learn about SQL.

In this project, Luke guide me to dive into the Job Market data. With focusing on Data Analyst, we explore Top Paying Jobs ðŸ’°, Most Demanded Skills ðŸ”Ž, and where high demands meets high salary ðŸ“ˆ in Data Analytics.

For the detail of SQL Queries, you can check out on [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from SQL Course by [Luke Barousse](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's paked with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions we have to answer through the SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

To dive into Data Analyst Job Market, I use several tools:

- **SQL:** to query the database and uncover some relevant insight.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database management system to handle the job posting data
- **Visual Studio Code:** Code Editor to execute the queries
- **Git and GitHub:** for version control and sharing option to ensure tracking and collaboration

# The Analysis

### 1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?

Showing up the highest paying jobs available for the Data Analyst role, starting by sorting jobs by the highest average yearly salary with the role of Data Analyst and that available fot remote working.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### 2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?

The analysis shows the skills most frequently associated with high-paying jobs are as follows:

![Top 10 Most Paying Jobs](assets/1_top_paying_jobs.png)

- SQL: Appeared 8 times.
- Python: Appeared 7 times.
- Tableau: Appeared 6 times.
- R: Appeared 4 times.
- Snowflake, Pandas, Excel: Appeared 3 times each.
- Azure, Bitbucket, Go: Appeared 2 times each.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

### 3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?

```sql
/* count jobs based on skill */
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT (job_title) AS total_jobs
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
GROUP BY
    (skills)
ORDER BY
    total_jobs DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### 4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

![Top 25 skills asociated with highest average yearly salary](assets/3_most_demanded_skills.png)

- Top Salary Trends: Companies value skills that combine Big Data, cloud computing, and machine learning.
- Multidisciplinary: Programming, data engineering, and DevOps infrastructure skills are key to high-paying positions.
- Career Future: Mastering tools like PySpark, Databricks, and Kubernetes can be the best skill investment for high-paying positions in data science and analytics.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG (salary_year_avg),0) AS average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC
LIMIT 25

```

### 5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) AS demanded_skills,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),0) AS average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id)  > 10
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```
